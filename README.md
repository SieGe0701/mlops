# MLOps Project

This repository is structured for learning and practicing MLOps principles. It includes folders for data, notebooks, source code, models, and tests.

## Structure
- `data/` - Raw and processed data
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and prototyping
- `src/` - Source code for ML pipeline (data loading, training, evaluation)
- `models/` - Saved and exported models
- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Explore the sample notebook in `notebooks/`
3. Run the example pipeline in `src/`

## Best Practices
- Use version control (git)
- Track experiments and models
- Write tests for your code
- Use automation for reproducibility
